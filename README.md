# PLncFire
A Scalable Pipeline for Transcriptome-wide Discovery of Plant lncRNAs

## Project Overview
The project PLncFire is a scalable and reproducible computational pipeline for genome-wide identification and annotation of plant long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from RNA-seq data. It integrates transcript assembly with consensus coding-potential assessment using CPC2, PlantLncPipe, and FEELnc to generate high-confidence known and novel lncRNA predictions, and supports downstream differential expression analysis across diverse plant species.

## Data Description
PLncFire processes high-throughput RNA-seq data (paired-end or single-end) generated from plant transcriptomes. The pipeline requires raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format and corresponding reference genome (FASTA) and gene annotation (GTF/GFF3) files. It supports data from both model and non-model plant species. Publicly available or user-generated RNA-seq datasets can be used for lncRNA discovery, annotation, and downstream differential expression analysis.
